## CustomerProfiler_AI_Version4
The CustomerProfiler project seeks to bridge the gap between accessability, data-migration decisions, and insight generation. The goal of this project is to optimize the migration process while maintaining data integrity and accuracy. An "AI" version of this workflow is available for access, and enables a seamless integration of data migrations across platfoms. The AI is designed to peform normalization, standardization, feature extraction, and feature selection task for rapid model development used to generate insight. Overtime, enabling an intelligent enginge for customer behavior profiling based on pricing options, community membership data, ECOM data will be added. 

## Standardization for Accessibility
  1) Business seeks to transition data environment to save on cost
  2) Challenge in migration include standardizing ECOM data, normalizing the datasets
  3) Requirement includes restructuring sales tables and redesinging its structure
  4) Stakeholders want real-time access to customer data for day-to-day marketing budgeting decisions

## Addressable Challgenges: 
  1) Enable extraction of meaningful insights for further analysis 
  2) Unify e-commerce data, normalize customer generated data, perform standardizing procedures to ensure interoperable base management (e.g. Snowflake and Databricks )
  3) Transition data into reliable single-silo table
