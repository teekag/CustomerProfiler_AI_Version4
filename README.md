# CustomerProfiler_AI_Version4
The customer profiler project seeks to bridge the gap between accessability, data-hosting decisions, and insight generation. The goal of this project is to optimize the migration process while maintaining data integrity and accuracy. An "AI" version of this workflow is available for access, and enables a seamless integration of data migrations across platfoms. The AI is intiially driven to peform normalization, standardization, feature extraction, and feature selection to create a rapid model development pipelines for further insight generation. Overtime, enabling an intelligent enginge for customer behavior profiling based on pricing options, community membership data, ECOM data will be added. 

Use Case: 
  1) Business seeks to transition data environment to save on cost
  2) Challenge in migration include standardizing ECOM data, normalizing the datasets
  3) Requirement includes restructuring sales tables and redesinging its structure
  4) Stakeholders want real-time access to customer data for day-to-day marketing budgeting decisions

Key Data-Standardization Issues: 
  1) Enable extraction of meaningful insights for further analysis 
  2) Unify time-series data, normalize customer bases by demographics, make data interoperable with Snowflake and Databricks
  3) Transition data into reliable single-silo table
